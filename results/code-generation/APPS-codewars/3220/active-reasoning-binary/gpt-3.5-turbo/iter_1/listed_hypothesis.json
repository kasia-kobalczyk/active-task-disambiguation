We can use the \"harmonic\" list provided in the code to generate these numbers. We need to find the harmonic numbers for all the numbers in the range (a, b) using the bisect_left function to find the index of the number in the harmonic list.\n2. Next, we need to find the pairs with the same ratios. We can create a dictionary \"harmonicity\" with the harmonic number as the key and the set of numbers as the value. We can iterate over this dictionary and select the pairs with the same ratios.\n3. Finally, we need to calculate the sum of the lowest members of each pair and return the result.\n\n# Steps\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary \"harmonicity\" to store the harmonic numbers and their corresponding numbers.\n2. Iterate over the range (a, b) and for each number, find its harmonic number using the bisect_left function on the \"harmonic\" list.\n3. Add the number to the set of numbers corresponding to its harmonic number in the \"harmonicity\" dictionary.\n4. Initialize an empty list \"pairs\" to store the pairs with the same ratios.\n5. Iterate over the values in the \"harmonicity\" dictionary and for each set of numbers, check if there are more than one number in the set.\n6. If there are more than one number, calculate the ratio for each pair of numbers in the set and add the pair to the \"pairs\" list if the ratio is the same as the harmonic number.\n7. Initialize the \"sum_lowest\" variable to 0 to store the sum of the lowest members of each pair.\n8. Iterate over the \"pairs\" list and for each pair, add the lowest member to the \"sum_lowest\" variable.\n9. Return the \"sum_lowest\" variable as the result.\n\n# Dry Run\n## Example 1\n### Input\n  a = 0\n  b = 200\n### Execution\n  - Calculate harmonic numbers for each number in the range (0, 200) using the bisect_left function.\n    - For n = 0, harmonic number is 0.\n    - For n = 1, harmonic number is 0.\n    - For n = 2, harmonic number is 2.\n    - For n = 3, harmonic number is 0.\n    - For n = 4, harmonic number is 2.\n    - For n = 5, harmonic number is 0.\n    - ...\n    - For n = 198, harmonic number is 33/198.\n    - For n = 199, harmonic number is 2.\n    - For n = 200, harmonic number is 2.\n  - Calculate the pairs with the same ratios.\n    - For harmonic number 0, there are two numbers in the set {0, 1}.
