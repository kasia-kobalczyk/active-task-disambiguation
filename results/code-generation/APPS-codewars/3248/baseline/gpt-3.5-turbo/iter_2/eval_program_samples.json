This is because we need to iterate over each note to find the one with the smallest difference in pitch.

This is because we need to iterate over each note to find the one with the smallest difference in pitch. The space complexity is O(1) since we only need a constant amount of space to store the variables `closest_note` and `min_diff`.",
