This is because we need to iterate over each note to find the one with the smallest difference in pitch. The space complexity is O(1) since we only need a constant amount of space to store the variables `closest_note` and `min_diff`.",

This is because we need to iterate over each note to find the one with the smallest difference in pitch. The space complexity is O(1) since we only need a constant amount of space to store the variables `closest_note` and `min_diff`.",
