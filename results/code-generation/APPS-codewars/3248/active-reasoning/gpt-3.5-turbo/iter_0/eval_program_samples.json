We initialize this to positive infinity so that any difference we calculate in the loop will be smaller.\n- Iterate over the notes dictionary using a for loop.\n    - Calculate the absolute difference between the current note's pitch and the given pitch.\n    - If the difference is smaller than the current closest difference, update `closest_note` to the current note and `closest_diff` to the current difference.\n    - If the difference is equal to the current closest difference, check if the current note's pitch is smaller than the closest note's pitch.

This is because we need to iterate over each note to find the one with the smallest difference in pitch. The space complexity is O(1) since we only need a constant amount of space to store the variables `closest_note` and `min_diff`.",
