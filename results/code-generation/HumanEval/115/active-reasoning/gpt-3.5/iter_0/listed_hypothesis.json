We can start by counting the number of units of water in each well and then calculating how many times we need to lower the buckets to empty the well.\n\nHere is one possible implementation:\n\n```\ndef max_fill(grid, capacity):\n    num_lowered = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        well_units = sum(row)\n        num_lowered += math.ceil(well_units / capacity)\n    return num_lowered\n```\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. We initialize a variable `num_lowered` to keep track of the total number of times we need to lower the buckets.\n2. We iterate over each row in the grid using a `for` loop.\n3. For each row, we calculate the total number of units of water in the well by summing the elements of the row using the `sum` function.\n4. We then divide the number of units by the capacity of the buckets and use the `math.ceil` function to round up to the nearest integer. This gives us the number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the well.\n5. We add this number to the `num_lowered` variable.\n6. Finally, we return the total number of times we need to lower the buckets.",
